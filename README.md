Steganography is a technique used in cybersecurity to hide information in seemingly ordinary files or messages. It's a form of covert communication that can be used to hide text, images, videos, or audio. 
How does steganography work?
The hidden data is extracted at its destination. 
The hidden data is sometimes encrypted before being hidden. 
If it isn't encrypted, it may be processed in some way to make it harder to detect. 
Uses of steganography
Companies use steganography to mask sensitive information when transmitting over insecure networks. 
Hackers use steganography to evade detection by hiding malicious data in plain sight. 
Steganography in cybersecurity
Steganography can be used to hide malware, exfiltrate data, or communicate discreetly. 
Steganography can be used in conjunction with encryption to conceal or protect data.
